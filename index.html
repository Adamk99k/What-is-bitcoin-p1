            <h2>Bitcoin, What is it?</h2>
            <p> Bitcoin is a digital asset that can be
                bought sold or transferred securely between parties
                over the internet.<br>
                <br>
                Bitcoin by some is also considered to be a great store
                of value similar to gold or silver or other
                investable assets. <br>
                <br>
                <em>Bitcoin ( aka: BTC ) </em> is also a form
                of digital currency that can be used to
                buy products and services or send money
                over the internet to anybody, anywhere.
                Unlike fiat money such as USD or GBP , Bitcoin isn't
                physical it's more like when you spend
                money on your visa or through PayPal. <br>
                <br>
                When you spend your Bitcoin a record of
                your Bitcoin account / (Wallet) gets modified on the blockchain 
                depending on whether you sent your bitcoins or you received some
                bitcoins and unlike traditional money there are
                <em>no banks, clearinghouses or middlemen</em>
                involved in the transaction. <br>
                <br>
                Nobody actually owns or controls the technology behind
                Bitcoin it's an open source peer-to-peer
                network built by an anonymous developer (More in the next section) 
                and maintained by the Bitcoin community.
                <br> 
                <br>
                That's part of what makes it so cool
                nobody can simply rush off and print
                more Bitcoin causing inflation or
                hyperinflation it's release is controlled and only <em>21 million bitcoins will
                 ever be produced.</em> <br>
                 <br>
                Lets not start getting too technical but let's look
                at how Bitcoin works.
                 
                First off we have to understand that one Bitcoin is broken
                down into <em>100 million pieces otherwise known as a Satoshi's
                it's represented as ( .00000001 ) of a bitcoin,
                you can own a full Bitcoin or a piece of a Bitcoin.</em> <br>
                <br>
                Sending or receiving Bitcoin is as easy as sending an email, But quick question. <em>Can you
                attach some money into an email and send it to somebody else?.....</em> of course
                not, not without using a third party like a bank or a company like PayPal. <br>
                <br>
                Now the reason you can't do it yourself is because somebody has to verify the
                transaction and record it and ensure that it is secure. <br>
                <br>
                When you email somebody a picture you actually create
                two copies of that, picture one is on your computer and another one is now on the reciving 
                computer, once they download it from the internet this is known as the double spend problem. <br>
                <br>
                Now without a third party to verify the transaction and update your ledger/(Account), it
                would be impossible to avoid counterfeit money or people trying to scam the system. <br>
                <br>
                So how are we able to send bitcoins back and forth without having a
                bank or another company involved the answer is in a powerful yet simple
                technology called the blockchain. <br>
                <br>
                <em>The blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology</em> that keeps a record of every
                Bitcoin transaction ever created, Its run by the Bitcoin network. 
                We won't go to much into detail about what the "Blockchain" is as it gets confusing but for now
                just know that bitcoin is comprised of four components.<br>
                <br>
                The first component is software in its simplest form. Bitcoin is the software, the software is created and
                maintained by the Bitcoin network and you have to be plugged into the software to participate in the bitcoin network.<br>
                <br>
                Now the second component is cryptography Bitcoin uses very secure cryptography to regulate the
                transfer of Bitcoin between parties as well as the creation of new Bitcoin.<br>
                <br>
                Hardware is the third component of Bitcoin now hardware is provided to the
                Bitcoin network by the miners, miners from all around the world supply
                thousands of specialized computers that are all connected to the Bitcoin network
                and running the Bitcoin client software. <br>
                <br>
                The fourth component of Bitcoin is probably the piece that ties it all
                together. Lets look at <em>gaming theory</em> as its abit more easy to grasp. <br>
                <br>
                Now at its core bitcoin is nothing more than a game played by the miners located all around
                the world, It works like this. The Bitcoin software every 10 minutes offers the bitcoin network a cryptographic
                challenge the challenge is to find the nouns in order to solve the hash and validate the blocks so after the
                challenge is issued the miners running their Hardware race to solve the noun and win the game, eventually one miners
                computer guesses the correct nouns and solves the challenge then the rest of
                the miners verify the validity which is called proof of work and the new block
                is officially mined and added to the Bitcoin blockchain and a copy is distributed to the blockchain
                as a reward the winning miner gets some
                Bitcoin thus creating new bitcoin's, These challenges are in other words <em>"extremely complex math equations".</em>
                Now thats bitcoin in its simplest form,<br>

            <h2>Some cool facts and points about BITCOIN</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</li>

            <li>Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system, known as a blockchain.</li>
            
            <li>Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent, it has gone through several cycles of boom and bust over its relatively short lifespan.</li>
            
            <li>As the earliest virtual currency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of other cryptocurrencies.</li>
            
            <li>Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?
                No one knows who invented Bitcoin, or at least not conclusively. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name associated with the person or group of people who released the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008 
                and worked on the original Bitcoin software that was released in 2009. <br>In the years since then, many individuals have either claimed to be or been rumored to be the real-life people behind bitcoin, but as of today, 2022.03.10 the true identity (or
                 identities) of Satoshi Nakamoto remains obscured. </li>
            
            
            <li>El Salvador became the first country to officially
                 adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in June 2021.</li>
            
            
            <li>Only 21 million Bitcoin can ever be produced. It's built into the coin's code or DNA. Right now, about 18.8 million have been mined, some lost forever. The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. <br> A true deflationary asset.</li>
            
            
            <li> A pizza purchase was the first commercial Bitcoin transaction
                On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas worth about $41 at the time. This was the first commercial Bitcoin transaction and is now commemorated through Bitcoin Pizza day each year.
                
                At 2021 price's, that 10,000 BTC would be worth over $700 million. Now thats crazy.  which is perhaps the real reason the story has become part of Bitcoin culture.</li>
