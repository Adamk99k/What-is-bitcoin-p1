                <h1 style="font-size: 60px; margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%;">Altcoin's . . . </h1>
                <p id="altcoins-text">Altcoins are simply every other cryptocurrencie that is not Bitcoin. <br>
                    <br>
                    The word Altcoin comes from <em>"Alternative" and "Coin"</em> which basically represents all alternatives to Bitcoin.<br>
                    <br>
                    The reason behind that was that Bitcoin made up more than <em>95%</em> of the cryptocurrency market cap in the early years, So all altcoins were a small distinct minority and had no significance compared to the first cryptocurrency ever (Bitcoin) over the years alternative cryptocurrency's have developed and grew in crazy value.<br>
                    <br>
                    Today altcoins make up the majority of the total crypto market capitalization, As of today (2022/03) Bitcoin only has a share of about 43% of the total marketcap for crypto, Meaning altcoins make up over 55% of the marketcap today, That's a huge jump from under 5% a few years ago to now over 55%..<br>
                    <br>
                    So why do altcoins exist and what is their purpose?<br>
                    <br>
                    It is sometimes misunderstood that altcoins are just copies of Bitcoin, Although some of the first altcoins such as <em> "Namecoin" </em> were very similar to Bitcoin
                    today thing's are very different.<br>
                    <br>
                    Altcoins provide services in some of the world's most important industries, What Bitcoin did to the financial
                    industry altcoins are doing to several industries.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the health industry altcoins such as <em>"Medibloc" and "Humanscape"</em> offer patient's an opportunity to own their health records.<br>
                    <br>
                    In entertainment there are blockchains such as <em>"Theta"</em> that offer decentralized video streaming, the list goes on and on their purpose is to create a better system for us to live in.<br>
                    <br>
                    Altcoins can be grouped in many categories because they have many use cases, for the purpose of keeping this information beginner friendly there will only be <em>four categories.</em><br>
                    <br>
                    One type of altcoin are <em>( stable coins )</em> the biggest stable coins by market cap are <em>( Tether-USDT )</em> and <em>( Usd coin- USDC )</em> stable coins are cryptocurrencies that follow the price of fiat currencies such as ( GBP/EURO ) or precious metals, They are pegged to these fiat currencies, Meaning the price is allways $1 or stable to whatever they are pegged to, they aim to reduce volatility and act as a reserve or collateral.<br>
                    <br>
                    Another type of altcoin are <em>( Utility tokens )</em>, utility tokens are cryptocurrencies that help funding the development of the project and can be used to buy something in the future, a good example would be ( Filecoin ) a altcoin that people buy in order to purchase storage space on it's decentralized network.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are also <em>mining based</em> altcoins, mining is the process of verifying transactions that also brings new coins to circulation most mining based 
                    altcoins use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Proof-of-work simply requires members of the network to expand processing power in order to solve mathematical puzzles to validate transactions, one example of such altcoin would be ( Litecoin - LTC ) whose purpose is to provide fast and low cost payments.<br>
                    <br>
                    The last type of altcoin that will be mentioned here are <em>( Meme coins )</em> as you can probably guess meme coins are cryptocurrencies that started as a joke and typically have no value or purpose other than to create hype and be a meme, the most popular examples would be ( Dogecoin )  and ( Shiba inu ) they depend on the popularity they gain from crypto influencers such as Elon musk who is openly promoting dogecoin adoptance.<br>
                    <br>
                    To sum up currently there are more than <em>18,000</em> altcoins and there will be many more created, unfortunately most of them will disappear in the years to come but the ones that survive will give incredible returns to the investors. </p>
