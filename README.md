# Time to learn about Bitcoin !

## Hello there and welcome to my first portfolio project for my [Code Institute Course.](https://codeinstitute.net/)

## Want to have a look at my project?   [What is Bitcoin](https://adamk99k.github.io/What-is-bitcoin-p1/)

#

The aim of my website is to simply educate and teach people about what Bitcoin and Altcoins are.  I wanted to create a website that has the main information about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency without the over-the-top information that may leave the user to get confused. So I decided to make this website with the intent to make it as simple and easy to follow along as possible. To make this idea possible I made three pages to my [What is Bitcoin? Website](https://adamk99k.github.io/What-is-bitcoin-p1/) the first page being the home page. This page includes two information sections and another section for quotes about bitcoin. in the first section about bitcoin I have made a easy to follow text sheet that explains the basics of bitcoin in its simplest form this includes how bitcoin works, What it does, Who controls the technology behind bitcoin and if its send able over the internet. This section will give the user all they need to know to grasp the basics of bitcoin. The following section on the home page is "Facts and points" In this second section the aim is to give bullet point type facts about bitcoin such as more information on "Satoshi Nakamoto", How many bitcoins are out there and other cool things about bitcoin such as a story about a person who spent 10,000 Bitcoin in its early years on some pizza, When making this section I wanted to make it so that once you read this section the user would be able to piece together parts they may not have understood in the first section about bitcoin.
The final section on the home page is a quote section. The aim of this section was to make the user feel more connected to the page, my logic behind this was if the user was to read a quote from someone they know, they would feel more involved and want to continue to read other pages. 
#
The second page is about altcoins, This page gives an explanation to what altcoins are in its simplest form and once the user of my website reads this they should be more clear on what altcoins are and feel more encouraged to learn more about all types of crypto. This section includes things like, what makes the word altcoin up, What the first altcoins were, What altcoins can be useful for and the four simple types of altcoins, 
#
The contact page was made for the user who has more questions and things they want clearing up, Users can leave their details and message and wait for further assistance and help. I have included a form like this because users who are completely new to the crypto space wonâ€™t really have a place to ask questions and get help. The contact page makes my website have the complete package feeling, Users can come read about bitcoin then altcoins, then ask anything they wish to.
#
The target audience for my website is all types of people from the younger generation to the older that want to know what bitcoin is, the idle user would be someone who has never learned about bitcoin and who is a complete newbie to this space as these users will gain the most value from my website.
